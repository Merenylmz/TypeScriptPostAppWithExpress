# TypeScript PostApp With Expressjs

In this project, I combined Typescript and Express js and used Repository Design pattern and there are two types of entities in the project, Category and Post. 

# To run it
Type "npm i" to install packages and "npm run start:dev" to run the application in develop mode and "npm run start" in build mode.
